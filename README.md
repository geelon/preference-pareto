# Preference Optimization on Pareto Sets: On a Theory of Multi-Objective Optimization

This repository contains the simple experiments run for this 
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02145). It compares the PMM algorithm in this
paper with the PNG algorithm by 
[Ye and Liu (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08713v2). No attempt has been 
made to optimize either code. The figures in the paper was generated by this 
[jupyter notebook](./visualization.ipynb).
